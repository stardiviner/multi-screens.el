* Intro

An Emacs minor mode contains helper utilities for multiple screens.

** Motivation

For example, like my workspace, I have multiple screens, I usually need to
switch Emacs frame to scroll PDF documents, source code files, and web browser
pages etc. So I created a minor mode which contains some helper utilities to
help user controlling this.

** auto display new frame in other screen

Setup KDE/Plasma KWin rules like this:
